# DepC: An Open Source Pore-Network Model for Studying Trapping and Remobilization of CO2 during Geological Storage

This is the executable version of the modified code, built upon the *numSCAL* code originally developed by Ahmed Hamdi Boujelben (2017) at Heriot-Watt University. 

New features have been added into the code (in C++) to model trapping and remobilization of residual CO2 under pressure depletion conditions.
